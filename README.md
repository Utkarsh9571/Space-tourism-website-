## Overview

### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### What I learned

Ok so this one is another back to back intermediate challenge because it comes in the learning path, with this one only 7-8 challenges left in intermediate challenges. and now i came to js frameworks chapter to learn, although i did not focus on css frameworks or preprocessors, i think i just have to go without them now, then had to learn later, but anyways focusing on this challenge,

this one introduced linking multiple pages, although this challenge gave multiple html files which i supposedly connect to be opened on clicking (a tags) or i can inject the right elements with updated data from data.json file. 

at first i thought i should do it with json method, but because there is similiar visual representation of multiple files i just applied the styples in them individually, which i think takes less time, well because i had done this before but the data.json js.

i think this challege is worth to be done another time with json method or watching its tutorial video on youtube.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
